# Covid-19 Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted the world, affecting individuals, communities, and economies on a global scale. As part of my exploratory data analysis (EDA) project, I conducted an analysis of COVID-19 data to gain insights into the spread of the virus, vaccination progress, and its impact on different regions and populations.

## Introduction

In this project, I analyzed two main datasets: COVID-19 deaths data (coviddeaths) and COVID-19 vaccinations data (covidvaccinations). The coviddeaths dataset provides information on total cases, total deaths, new cases, and population across various locations and dates. The covidvaccinations dataset contains data on new vaccinations administered across different locations and dates.

## Project Highlights

- Explore COVID-19 Spread: Investigate the spread of COVID-19 by analyzing trends in total cases, total deaths, and new cases across different locations and dates.
- Examine Vaccination Progress: Assess the progress of COVID-19 vaccination efforts by analyzing new vaccinations administered and their cumulative total over time.
- Understand Impact on Population: Investigate the impact of COVID-19 on population health by analyzing the percentage of population infected and the percentage vaccinated in various locations.
- Identify High-Risk Areas: Identify regions with the highest infection rates, death counts, and vaccination rates to understand where interventions may be needed most urgently.


## Conclusion

Through my exploratory data analysis, I gained valuable insights into the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. I observed significant variations in the spread of the virus and vaccination progress across different locations and populations.
